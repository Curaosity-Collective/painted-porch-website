            <p className="text-body">If something goes sideways, we'd rather reason through it than fight about it. That instinct has a name, the Stoics called it <em>preferred indifference to conflict</em>, the practice of meeting disputes <em>sine ira et studio</em> (without anger, without favor), and it's why we've chosen arbitration over interpretive dance, megaphone-wielding, or full-blown litigation.</p>
            <p className="text-body">This AGREEMENT is governed by the laws of the State of Arizona without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. Any dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to this AGREEMENT will be resolved by binding arbitration in Phoenix, Maricopa County, Arizona, under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration is binding upon the PARTIES and their successors in interest. The prevailing party may collect all reasonable legal fees from the non-prevailing party.</p>
            <p className="text-body"><strong>Class-action waiver.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, each party waives any right to bring or participate in a class, collective, or representative action against the other. Disputes proceed only on an individual basis.</p>
            <p className="text-body"><strong>Jury trial waiver.</strong> Each party waives the right to a jury trial for any dispute not subject to arbitration.</p>
            <p className="text-body"><strong>Carve-outs.</strong> Either party may bring an individual claim in small-claims court if eligible, and either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to protect intellectual property or confidential information.</p>
            <p className="text-body"><strong>30-day opt-out.</strong> You may opt out of the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions by emailing <PolicyLink /> within 30 days of first accepting these terms, with the subject "Arbitration opt-out" and your full name and the email associated with your account.
