const faqItems = [
  {
    question: "How is AMPLIFY different from IGNITE?",
    answer: "IGNITE is self-paced individual development. AMPLIFY is team-based learning (workshops, sprints, cohorts). IGNITE builds your capacity. AMPLIFY builds team or organizational capacity.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the format for Leadership Labs?",
    answer: "Leadership Labs are 6-12 week cohort-style programs with bi-weekly or monthly sessions, peer accountability, and individual coaching touchpoints. Each lab focuses on a specific theme (Stractical Leadership, Leading Change, etc.) and is capped at 25 leaders from different organizations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if a Leadership Lab is right for me?",
    answer: "Leadership Labs are designed for individual leaders ready to deepen their transformation capacity through peer learning, whether you're developing yourself before bringing concepts to your team or investing in your own leadership independent of organizational initiatives.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I join a Leadership Lab if I'm also bringing my team to a workshop?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Many leaders participate in labs for their own development while separately engaging their teams in workshops or sprints. Leadership Labs focus on individual leadership capacity; workshops/sprints focus on team alignment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do we need the Epic ShIFt Organizational Appraisal before AMPLIFY?",
    answer: "Not required for leadership labs. Required for Strategic Sprints and multi-day workshops. Highly recommended (but not required) for single-day workshops. Our Epic ShIFt Organizational Appraisal provides the foundation for workshop focus and sprint partnerships.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we do a workshop first, then decide on Strategic Sprint?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Many teams start with a workshop to test fit, then progress to sprint if deeper partnership makes sense.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if our team is geographically distributed?",
    answer: "We facilitate virtual workshops and sprints effectively. In-person is ideal when possible, but not required.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in the investment?",
    answer: "Pre-work, facilitation, frameworks/tools, post-workshop resources, and ongoing advisory sessions for questions and continued guidance.",
