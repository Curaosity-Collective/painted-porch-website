    question: "How is EMBODY different from traditional consulting?",
    answer:
      "Traditional consultants hand you a best-practice playbook. EMBODY is a true partnership. You're the expert on your organization. We're experts in the architecture that makes shIFt stick. Together we co-design what your organization is built to lead, then build the structural capacity to sustain it. You leave with permanent capability.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is EMBODY different from change management?",
    answer:
      "Change management starts after the direction is set. EMBODY is change origination. We partner upstream, at the strategic authorship moment, to architect the shIFt you intend to lead before a single tool gets launched.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does EMBODY start with the Epic ShIFt Appraisal?",
    answer:
      "The Epic ShIFt Appraisal is how we (and you) see the three Painted Porch Pillars clearly. Without that reading, any partnership is a guess. With it, we co-design an EMBODY engagement that fits your actual architecture, not a template.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if the Epic ShIFt Appraisal shows we're not ready for EMBODY yet?",
    answer:
      "That's one of the most valuable things it can surface. Your results will include a Reinforcement Path that maps what needs strengthening first, often through AMPLIFY sprints or IGNITE work. We'd rather point you to the right starting line than sell you an engagement your organization can't yet carry.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we start with AMPLIFY or IGNITE and grow into EMBODY?",
    answer:
      "Yes, and many partners do exactly that. IGNITE builds individual capacity. AMPLIFY builds team and sprint-level momentum. EMBODY is the embedded, organization-wide partnership for leaders ready to architect transformation at the structural level.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does an EMBODY partnership actually look like week to week?",
    answer:
      "Typically bi-weekly or monthly strategic sessions with senior leadership, plus office hours access in between. We move through the full P.A.T.H.: Prepare, Align, Take Off, and Habit. The exact cadence is co-designed with you.",
  },
  {
    question: "What outcomes can we expect from EMBODY?",
