        question: "Is the EQ-i 2.0 assessment for me?",
        answer:
          "The EQ-i 2.0 Assessment is for anyone 18 years of age or over who is seeking clarity and awareness of how you perceive and express yourself, develop and maintain social relationships, cope with challenges, and use emotional information in an effective and meaningful way. While you may not be in an official Leader role, each of us leads and influences ourselves and others in how we show up, share our thoughts and ideas, collaborate, solve problems, and manage stress.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long is the assessment?",
        answer:
          "The online EQ-i 2.0 Assessment includes 133 statements where you will note the frequency with which you think, feel, or act for each one. The average time it takes to complete is between 20–30 minutes, and it must be completed in one session, but there is no imposed time limit. There are no 'good' or 'bad' choices or 'right' or 'wrong' answers.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long will I have access to take the assessment?",
        answer:
          "Shortly after purchase (within 24–48 hours), you will receive an email with a link to access and complete your EQ-i 2.0 assessment. This link will remain active for 30 days. If you are unable to complete the assessment within that time, simply email support@paintedporchstrategies.com to request a new link.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens after I complete the assessment?",
        answer:
          "Once you've completed the assessment, you will receive a follow-up email to schedule your 45-minute debrief call with our team. You will receive a copy of your report immediately prior to your scheduled session. During your call, we'll review your results, answer any questions, and work with you to design your EQ Action Plan.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does the EQ-i 2.0 compare to other EQ assessments?",
        answer:
          "For almost 20 years, consultants and organizations have trusted the science that underpins the EQ-i 2.0 to improve human performance. The EQ-i was the first scientifically validated measure of emotional intelligence and was developed through an extensive process ensuring its content reflects the model and scope of EI, truly measures the concept, and has a structure that is dependable and applicable across a wide variety of contexts.",

      {
        question: "Do you offer other EQ-i Assessments or Training?",
