        question: "Is the Working Genius assessment for me?",
        answer:
          "If you've ever wondered why some work energizes you while other tasks drain you (even when you're good at them), Working Genius is for you. It's a 10-minute assessment that helps anyone, in any role, understand the kinds of work that fit their natural gifts and the kinds that frustrate them. It's especially powerful for leaders, teams, and anyone wanting to do work that brings them joy.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long does the assessment take?",
        answer:
          "The online Working Genius assessment takes about 10 minutes to complete. There are no right or wrong answers. You'll answer questions about how you naturally think and work, and you'll receive a personalized report identifying your two areas of genius, two areas of competency, and two areas of frustration.",
      },
      {
        question: "What are the 6 Types of Working Genius?",
        answer:
          "The 6 types spell out the acronym W.I.D.G.E.T.: Wonder (asking the big questions), Invention (generating new ideas and solutions), Discernment (evaluating ideas and giving feedback), Galvanizing (rallying people to action), Enablement (jumping in to help), and Tenacity (driving work across the finish line). Everyone has two types they're naturally great at (their genius), two they can do but find draining, and two that frustrate them.",

        question: "Who created Working Genius?",
        answer:

          "The $25 option is the basic Working Genius assessment purchased directly from The Table Group. You complete the assessment and receive your personalized PDF report on your own. The $297 option adds a 45-minute one-on-one debrief call with our team, where together we read your results, see how your genius shows up in your real-world work, and design an action plan to lean into your strengths and protect your energy.",

If you purchase from us, you'll receive a custom link to complete your Working Genius assessment within 24 hours. Then, once completed, you'll receive an email to book your debrief.
