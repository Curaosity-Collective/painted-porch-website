/**
 * Strategic Sprints: focused 90-day Phase Zero partnership.
 *
 * Refactored per the wireframe (.lovable/wireframes/embody-and-sprints-revised.md):
 *  - Timeline labels: Diagnose → Design → Direction (no "Deliver"; nothing is
 *    actually implemented in 90 days; the output is a plan + direction).
 *  - Kept "Common Applications" (helps tactical self-qualification).
 *  - NEW contrast strip: "Not a traditional implementation engagement".
 *  - Merged Blue Door prerequisite into the Investment row.
 *  - Sprints Playbook PDF = "Coming soon".

          "You will have implemented a whole new approach to how you prepare for and design future strategic initiatives and direction. A Sprint is the Phase Zero work that comes before broad implementation. You'll leave with an architecture blueprint and a clear roadmap of what to build, in what order, and why.
