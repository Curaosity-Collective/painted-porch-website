    name: "Leadership Labs",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "What's the format for Leadership Labs?",
        answer: "Leadership Labs are 6-12 week cohort-style programs with weekly or biweekly sessions and peer accountability. Each lab focuses on a specific theme (Stractical Leadership, Leading Change, etc.) and is capped at 25 leaders from different organizations.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know if a Leadership Lab is right for me?",
        answer: "Leadership Labs are for individual leaders who want to grow how they lead change, alongside peers. Some come to develop themselves before bringing ideas to their team. Others invest in their own leadership, apart from any organizational initiative.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can I join a Leadership Lab if I'm also bringing my team to a workshop?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Many leaders participate in labs for their own development while separately engaging their teams in workshops or Architect ShIFt. Leadership Labs focus on individual leadership capacity; workshops and Architect ShIFt focus on team and organizational alignment.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need the Epic ShIFt Organizational Appraisal before joining a Leadership Lab?",
        answer: "No. Leadership Labs are designed for individual leaders, so they stand on their own, without an organizational appraisal.",
      },
      {
        question: "What if I'm not in an official leadership capacity?",
        answer: "We believe leadership isn't based on your title or role. It's based on your ambition, attitude, and desire. We welcome all - official \"capital L\" Leaders, as well as those aspiring to lead themselves and others with courage, curiosity, clarity, and the capacity to make shIFt happen.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    name: "Waitlist & Upcoming Cohorts",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "When is the next cohort?",
        answer: "We run Leadership Labs a few times per year. Join the waitlist and you'll be the first to know when new dates are announced.",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens after I join the waitlist?",
        answer: "You'll receive a confirmation that you're on the list. When we schedule the next cohort, waitlist members get first access and priority enrollment before we open spots to the public.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is there any cost to join the waitlist?",
        answer: "No. Joining the waitlist is completely free and there's no obligation. It simply ensures you're notified first when enrollment opens.",
      },
      {
        question: "I missed the last cohort. Will the content be the same?",
        answer: "The core frameworks and exercises stay consistent, but each cohort benefits from fresh examples, updated case studies, and the unique dynamics of a new group of leaders. No two cohorts are exactly alike.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    name: "General",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "How is this different from self-led learning?",
        answer: "Self-led resources (assessments, masterclasses and mini courses) build your own capacity, at your own pace. Workshops and Leadership Labs build it together, with your team or a cohort of peers.",
      },
