                  Before you commit budget, headcount, and eighteen months of attention, there is a
                  version of this move that is bigger than the one currently on the table. The Blue
                  Door is a structured organizational appraisal that reads all three Pillars at once
                  and shows you which one you are actually positioned to lead.

                  Your organization was designed, structurally and culturally, for a version of itself

                  Serious leaders take one deliberate pause before they commit. The Blue Door is that
                  pause, made structured: an organizational appraisal across culture, operations, and
