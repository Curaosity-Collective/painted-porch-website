/**
 * Source-tree link audit for workshop / speaking routes.
 *
 * Runs without DB / network. Complements
 * `scripts/validate-workshop-routing.mjs` (which audits DB rows).
 * This script catches source-tree regressions:
 *
 *   1. No stray "accordion" references in the workshop/speaking pages.
 *      The old accordion layout on /workshops was
 *      reverted in favor of the /speaking/topics page — those files
 *      must not reference it (shadcn accordion primitive elsewhere is
 *      still fine).
 *   2. Any hardcoded `/workshops#<anchor>` link uses
 *      an anchor that AmplifyWorkshops.tsx actually renders.
 *   3. Any hardcoded `/speaking/topics#<slug>` link uses a slug that
 *      matches the kebab-case pattern used by anchor_id / topic_slug.
 *      (Existence-of-slug is enforced against the DB by the routing
 *      validator; this pass just catches typos like camelCase leftovers.)
 *
 * Exit 0 on clean, 1 on any violation.
